 * Traffic Simulation in Python
Overview
This Python project simulates traffic flow on a circular road using a density-based model. It calculates the average speed of cars, visualizes their movement over time, and analyzes the relationship between car density and velocity. The simulation provides insights into how traffic congestion impacts vehicle speeds.

Features
Traffic Simulation: Models car movement on a circular road based on user-defined parameters (road length, timesteps, and car density).

Visualization: Generates plots for:

Car positions over time.

Velocity trends over time.

Relationship between car density and average velocity.

Density Analysis: Simulates traffic at multiple densities to analyze steady-state speeds.

Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-simulation.git
cd traffic-simulation
Install the required Python libraries:

bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
How to Run
Open a terminal or IDE.

Run the script:

bash
python 4.-Traffic.py
Input the required parameters when prompted:

Length of the road (n): Number of positions on the circular road.

Number of timesteps (t): Duration of the simulation.

Car density (d): Fraction of road occupied by cars (e.g., 0.5 for 50% density).

Outputs
The program generates the following visualizations:

Car Position vs Time
A graph showing how cars move over time on a circular road.

Velocity vs Time
A plot showing how the average velocity of cars changes as time progresses.

Velocity vs Density
A scatter plot illustrating the relationship between car density and steady-state velocity.

Code Structure
traffic Class
The traffic class encapsulates the logic for simulating and analyzing traffic flow.

Attributes
n: Length of the road (number of positions).

t: Number of timesteps for the simulation.

d: Car density (fraction of road occupied by cars).

Methods
create_road(): Initializes the road layout based on car density.

simulation(road): Simulates car movement over time and calculates average speeds.

graphing_road(road, av_speeds): Visualizes car positions over time and plots velocity trends.

multiple_density_simulation(road_2): Simulates traffic at varying densities until steady-state speed is achieved.

plot_multiple_densities(ss_speeds): Plots velocity vs density for multiple simulations.

Main Function
The main() function handles user input, runs simulations, and generates visualizations.

Example Usage
When you run the script, you will be prompted to input parameters like this:

text
Please input the length of the road: 50
Please input the amount of timesteps: 100
Please enter the car density: 0.5
After entering these values, the program will generate:

A plot showing car positions over time.

A plot showing velocity trends over time.

A scatter plot showing how velocity varies with car density.

Dependencies
This project requires Python 3.x and the following libraries:

numpy

matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip:

bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
Project Workflow
The user provides inputs for road length (n), timesteps (t), and car density (d).

The program initializes a circular road with cars placed randomly based on density.

Cars move according to rules that check neighboring positions (wrap-around behavior ensures circular movement).

The program calculates average speeds at each timestep and generates visualizations.

For varying densities, it computes steady-state speeds and plots velocity vs density.

Results
Key Observations:
As car density increases, average velocity decreases due to congestion.

Steady-state speeds are achieved after several timesteps for each density level.

This project provides valuable insights into traffic dynamics and helps understand how congestion impacts movement efficiency.
