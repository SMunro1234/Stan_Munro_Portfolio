 * Derivative and Extremum Calculation Project
 *
 * Overview:
 * This project contains C++ code to calculate the first and second derivatives of a function
 * and to find the extrema (minimum or maximum) of a function. The project includes the following files:
 * - main_deriv.c
 * - derivatives.c
 * - derivatives.h
 * - extremum.c
 * - extremum.h
 *
 * Prerequisites:
 * Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
 * - GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
 * - Visual Studio Code
 * - C/C++ extension for Visual Studio Code
 *
 * Compiling and Running the Code:
 *
 * Using Command Prompt:
 * 1. Navigate to the project directory:
 *    Open Command Prompt and navigate to the directory where your source files are located.
 *    cd path\to\your\project
 *
 * 2. Compile the code:
 *    Use the following command to compile the code using g++:
 *    g++ -g main_extremum.cpp derivatives.cpp extremum.cpp solve.cpp -o extremum_test -lm
 *
 * 3. Run the executable:
 *    Run the compiled executable to generate the a extremum_test.dat file.
 *    ./extremum_test
 *
 * Output:
 * After running the executable, a file named extremum_test.dat will be generated in the project directory.
 *
